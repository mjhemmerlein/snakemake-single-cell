## README

I plan to make a snakemake pipeline to generate read count matrices from 10X multiome (Gene Expression and ATAC sequencing) data. The pipeline will include multiple steps, including building a custom reference (Peromyscus maniculatus), generating a cell matrix using the 10X CellRanger ARC package, and visualizing the result files.
